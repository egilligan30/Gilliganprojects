  Welcome to my GitHub. This page is meant to serve as a sort of online portfolio for my professional work. Below I have available some of my research in economics and work in programming.

  <h2>About Me</h2>

    <div style="flex: 1;">
      <p>
        I am currently a 4th Year at the University of Virginia studying Economics and Classics with a minor in Mathematics. My current research interests include Industrial Organization and 
        Game Theory. In the near future, I am open to any and all research opportunities
        related to IO or Game Theory. Later down the line, I hope to eventually apply to PhD programs for economics.

  <h3>Sports Betting &amp; Bankruptcy Research</h3>
  <p><strong>Title:</strong> <a href="bankruptcyosb.pdf" target="_blank"><em>An Analysis on Bankruptcy and Mortgage Delinquency after Online Sports Betting Legalization</em></a></p>
  <p>An empirical paper studying the effect of online sports betting legalization on bankruptcy rates in the U.S. Visit the abstract of the paper for a summary of my findings, methodology, and analysis.</p> 
    <p>Briefly, this paper is motivated by the rapid rise of online sports 
    betting in the United States following the U.S. Supreme Court overturning the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PAPSA) in 2018. Since then, modern media 
    has extensively covered both the benefits and downsides of online sports betting. A troubling contradiction exists within the sports world itself as while professional betting scandals 
    become increasingly prevalent, these same leagues, on the other hand, continue to sell their advertisement rights to the very sportsbooks involved. Regardless, I hope that my findings meaningfully contribute to the 
    ongoing policy debate surrounding the legalization of sports betting.</p>

  <h3>Basic Linear Algebra Calculator for Square Matrices</h3>
  <p>A Python program using <code>sympy</code> that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Performs row-reduction to RREF with detailed expansions</li>
    <li>Computes determinant of square matrices</li>
    <li>Calculates matrix inverses with step-by-step verification</li>
    <li>Interact with the tool: Download the code and enter your matrix in accordance with the instructions to calculate inverses, determinants, and RREF step-by-step.</li> 
    <li><a href="matrixinvdetrrefcalc.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Access the calculator here</a>.</li>
  </ul>


  <h3>Basic Experimental Economics oTree Game</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Developed an oTree-based behavioral simulation in Python modeling stochastic betting behavior, mortgage payments, and bankruptcy dynamics across multiple experimental rounds.</li>
    <li>Implemented dynamic state updates for player variables based on probabilistic bet outcomes and fixed financial constraints.</li>
    <li>Defined custom oTree models and constants to parameterize experiment settings, ensuring reproducibility, modularity, and controlled simulation of financial decision processes.</li>
