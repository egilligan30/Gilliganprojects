<h1>Edward Gilligan</h1>
<p>
  Welcome to my GitHub. This page is meant to serve as a sort of online portfolio for my professional work. Below I have available some of my research in economics and work in programming.

  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
    <div style="flex: 1;">
      <p>
      I’m a 4th Year Economics undergraduate at the University of Virginia with a strong interest in applied research, quantitative methods, and understanding how markets and policies shape real‑world outcomes. 
        My academic focus spans industrial organization, behavioral and experimental economics, and econometrics, and I enjoy working at the intersection of economic theory and data.
<p>
       <p>I currently serve as a Research Assistant in the UVA Department of Economics, where I collaborate with faculty on projects in behavioral economics and applied IO. My work includes literature reviews, experiment design, data construction and analysis, and providing feedback on empirical strategies and theoretical framing. 
In my coursework and independent projects, I’ve built large‑scale structural demand models using supermarket scanner data, conducted causal analyses with panel datasets to evaluate policy impacts, and developed behavioral simulations in Python using oTree. <p>
<p>I bring a strong technical skill set, with advanced experience in Python and Stata and working knowledge of R, MATLAB, SQL, Tableau, and LaTeX. With a background in economics, mathematics, and classics, 
  I value analytical precision as well as clear reasoning and communication. I’m interested in pursuing research‑driven roles and, eventually, graduate study in economics or a related field. </p>

<h3>Estimating Demand and Market Outcomes</h3>
<p><strong>Title:</strong> <a href="demandestimation.pdf" target="_blank"><em>Demand Estimation for Oatmeal</em></a></p>
  <p>This study examines consumer demand for oatmeal products in order to understand how pricing decisions influence both revenue and customer welfare in a differentiated grocery category. 
    Using more than 750,000 observations from Dominick’s supermarket scanner data, the analysis applies a Berry logit framework with extensive fixed effects to estimate price elasticities, 
    identify substitution patterns, and measure variation in consumer responsiveness across product types. The motivation is to provide retailers and category managers with an evidence‑based 
    view of how consumers react to price changes and product attributes, particularly in settings where simple correlations fail to capture endogenous pricing or unobserved quality differences. 
    The results show an average own‑price elasticity of about 1.75 and significantly higher sensitivity for instant oatmeal products. Counterfactual simulations quantify the impact of uniform price 
    increases, targeted adjustments, and package size changes on revenue and welfare, revealing consistent numerical tradeoffs between profitability and consumer benefit. 
    The findings demonstrate how elasticity variation and substitution dynamics determine the outcomes of practical pricing strategies.<p>

<h3>Sports Betting &amp; Bankruptcy Research</h3>
<p><strong>Title:</strong> <a href="bankruptcyosbworking.pdf" target="_blank"><em>An Analysis on Bankruptcy and Mortgage Delinquency after Online Sports Betting Legalization</em></a></p>
<p>An empirical paper studying the effect of online sports betting legalization on bankruptcy rates in the U.S. Visit the abstract of the paper for a summary of my findings, methodology, and analysis.</p> 
<p>Briefly, this paper is motivated by the rapid rise of online sports 
betting in the United States following the U.S. Supreme Court overturning the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) in 2018. Since then, modern media 
has extensively covered both the benefits and downsides of online sports betting. A troubling contradiction exists within the sports world itself as while professional betting scandals 
become increasingly prevalent, these same leagues, on the other hand, continue to sell their advertisement rights to the very sportsbooks involved. Regardless, I hope that my findings meaningfully contribute to the 
ongoing policy debate surrounding the legalization of sports betting.</p>
